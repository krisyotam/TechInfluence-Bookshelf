## Kris Yotam's Insights

This book had a profound impact on my perspective as a tech leader. It made me realize that even the most successful companies can be vulnerable to innovation that disrupts their industries. I learned the importance of remaining adaptable and open to change, even when things seem to be going well. The idea that sustaining innovation can blind us to disruptive threats has guided my decision-making, encouraging me to foster a culture of continuous innovation within Lael Corp.

## Key Takeaways

- Established companies tend to focus on sustaining innovations, but disruptive technologies can emerge and reshape industries.
- Successful companies often overlook disruptive innovations due to their focus on satisfying existing customers.
- A dual strategy is needed: maintaining core business while also exploring disruptive technologies.
